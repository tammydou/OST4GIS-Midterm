        <h1> FIND A FARMERS MARKET NEAR YOU! </h1>
        <p class="main"> Surrounded by richly fertile farmland and home to innovative urban growing projects, Philadelphia is a market-goer’s dream. Year-round and seasonally, open-air stalls dot the city and countryside, from the bustling indoor Reading Terminal Market to the gingham-clothed tables of the Phoenixville Market, collectively connecting consumers to freshly grown and produced food every day of the week. With many accepting electronic payments, Philly’s growing roster of farmers’ markets has made eating fresh, local food an easy way of life.
        Here, your master list of farmers markets in the Philadelphia region. </p>

        <h1> More to Market: Cooking Demonstrations </h1>
        <p> Many of The Food Trust's farmers markets throughout Philadelphia and its surrounding counties offer free cooking demonstrations where
           customers can learn to cook healthy meals using seasonal produce found right at market. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Activities include low-cost cooking recipes, free food tastings, nutrition and cooking tips as well as giveaways. At many of our farmers
           markets, watching a cooking demonstration or participating in a taste test can earn you $4 in Philly Food Bucks, which can be used
           immediately on fresh fruits and vegetables. </p>
